## How to build

Add your `google_maps_key` in a file called `app/src/debug/res/values/google_maps_api.xml` (and, for me, `app/src/release/res/values/google_maps_api.xml`)

    <resources>
        <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">yourKeyHere</string>
    </resources>

Then just build it in Android Studio.
