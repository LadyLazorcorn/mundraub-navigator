## I went to a marker but couldn't find anything

Mundraub has a visual bug where marker images are anchored at the center and not the tip/bottom. This might lead to users placing markers north of where they wanted to place them, so try checking the area directly south of the marker.

## Is this app official?

I've been in contact with Kai from Mundraub, and he approves of the app (and the name and asset use). But I did all the development and am in charge of all development decisions.

## How to build

Add your `google_maps_key` in a file called `app/src/debug/res/values/google_maps_api.xml` (and, for me, `app/src/release/res/values/google_maps_api.xml`)

    <resources>
        <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">yourKeyHere</string>
    </resources>

Then just build it in Android Studio.
